# Statistics-through-R-Language
Performing analysis on different data/datasets, through R-language, and plotting graphs etc


Question 1:

Do social robots walk or roll? According to the United Nations, social robots now outnumber industrial robots worldwide. A social (or service) robot is designed to entertain, educate, and care for human users. In a paper published by the International Conference on Social Robotics (Vol. 6414, 2010), design engineers investigated the trend in the design of social robots. Using a random sample of 106 social robots obtained through a web search, the engineers found that 63 were built with legs only, 20 with wheels only, 8 with both legs and wheels, and 15 with neither legs nor wheels. 

a. Use R Code to construct a pie chart to organize the data. What can you conclude? 
b. Construct a bar plot for the above data.



Question 2:

a. Take a built-in R dataset to construct bar chart through R-language.
b. Take a data named, Diamonds from R. Describe the summary of the data set. Which variable is most significant for predicting the price of a diamond? Support your answer.



Question 3:

Collect the data (40-50 values) on a targeted variable. Construct the frequency distribution through R-Language.

a. List the mid-points for your frequency distribution, as well as the relative and cumulative frequencies using R- Language.
b. Draw a histogram and superimpose a frequency polygon on top of a histogram through R-language.
Hint: You can use rnorm function to generate continuous data.



Question 4:

A dataset of Covid 19 cases is given to you. Using R language, answer the following questions:

a. How many countries are included in this study?
b. For China, in which provinces were covid cases found? Also, find the cumulative death cases for China?
c. Describe the summary of the entire data.
d. Plot the trend of Covid 19 confirmed cases, number of deaths and number of recovered cases for the province South Australia. 
[All three plots should be displayed on one window.]
e. Write the data into a file of the cases which were reported after 1 st January 2021.
